### TCP (Transmission control protocol), UDP (user datagram protocol) IP (Internet protocol)
- TCP ensures reliable and ordered communication with a connection-oriented
approach, UDP prioritizes speed and is connectionless, and IP manages the addressing
and routing for data packets across networks. Together, they form the backbone of
internet communication.

### Ports
 - Ports are communication endpoints that allow different services on a device to send

- they are useful in configuring, networking settings, defining rules for firewalls, managing container communication, orchestrating services, and troubleshooting network issues.
### CIDR (Class less inter domain routing)
- a method for allocating IP addresses
- used in security group rules, AWS networking
